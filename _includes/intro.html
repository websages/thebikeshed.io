      <p class="goal">Our goal is simple: we are technologists that are and want to
      continue to be involved with the local community. With the ample hack space
      that we currently have &mdash; in-office viking table, shared coworking space
      &mdash; we have room to host meetup groups, hack nights, Nashville Software
      School study sessions, etc.</p>

      <p>We have room to host ~25-35 people without breaking a sweat, which is difficult to find in general in Nashville. On top of that, we try to capture a bit of the GitHub spirit combined with the BNA team to have a place that reflects a nice place to want to work.</p>

      <p>If you're ever in Nashville, know that you have a space to hack, friends to 🍺 with, and of course, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_chicken"><span title="hot chicken">🔥&nbsp;🐔</span></a> and 🌆&nbsp;🎵 to soothe your soul.</p>
