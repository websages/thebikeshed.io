When you arrive, you are greeted with some wonderful signage (hat tip
[@jameswhite's](https://github.com/jameswhite) brother who made
these vinyl stickers out of our public media assets).

## Features

- Full double - kegerator. [@rick](https://github.com/rick) acquired this beauty from a brewmaster friend who coincidentally also brings by tasty homebrews. We lovingly created a tap handle out of his head with modeling software [@azizshamim](https://github.com/azizshamim) gathered up, and superimposed it on an existing tap handle. Concept to finished product: ~5 hours (includes printing time).
- 10-foot farm table. Lovingly suppled by [@jameswhite](https://github.com/jameswhite), this custom-made farm table can seat 10, complete with power üîå for every person. Early beta-testing shows this is ideal for hacking, drinking üçª, or playing board games.
- Philips Hue bulbs in every lamp and window. Currently wired up for a few uses, such as turning orange when someone is in a meeting. More importantly, Disco Mode!
- 65" Plasma TV for epic beer:30 talks, gaming, or other tomfoolery to be had during the week(-end). (hat tip [@jameswhite](https://github.com/jameswhite) for our epic stand holding up the TV)
- Raspberry PIs everywhere! Check out [our dashboards](https://github.com/websages/dashboards-bnagh) that show various metrics/data about the Bikeshed.
- We also have cameras to check out what's going on in the office from anywhere!
